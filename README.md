Windows may stop the program from running. This is because it does not recognize the application, which is normal. If this happens click 'More Info' and then 'Run anway'.

## How To Use
Like the terminal, this program runs based off (pseudo-)directories and commands that the user inputs. When the program starts you will be in the Root directory, shown as just `>`. From here you can enter any command that works in the Root directory or any directory.
