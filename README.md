Windows may stop the program from running, this is because it does not recognize the application, which is normal. If this happens click 'More Info' and then 'Run anway'.

## How To Use
Like the terminal, this program runs based off (pseudo-)directories and commands that the user inputs. When the program starts you will be in the Root directory, shown as just ">". From here you can enter any command that works in the Root directory or any directory. A full list of commands, their arguments, and their valid directories can be seen in the [Wiki](https://github.com/jopo86/QuizMaker/wiki/Documentation) or by the `help -more` command.
