# QuizMaker
A C++ terminal-like program to create, take, & share quizzes.  
This project is still in development.

## Installation
To install, simply download the zip file below, extract it, and run QuizMaker.exe under the QuizMaker folder. Once downloaded, you can move the QuizMaker folder anywhere.  
[Latest Release (0.1.0-alpha)](https://mega.nz/file/S8xTXCaC#WTrVAfXbHOqeEbsJOS01-MBW9qSSXGNM3woWWvI5-Qw)  
[All Releases](https://mega.nz/folder/Xlxk0JhR#GEoC0FFyyR9OX82k4XjYNg)

Windows may stop the program from running, this is because it does not recognize the application, which is normal. If this happens click 'More Info' and then 'Run anway'.

## How To Use
Like the terminal, this program runs based off (pseudo-)directories and commands that the user inputs. When the program starts you will be in the Root directory, shown as just ">". From here you can enter any command that works in the Root directory or any directory. A full list of commands, their arguments, and their valid directories can be seen in the [Wiki](https://github.com/jopo86/QuizMaker/wiki/Documentation) or by the `help -more` command.
