# QuizMaker
A C++ terminal-like program to create, take, & share quizzes.

## Installation
To install, simply download the cross-platform executable here.

## How To Use
Like the terminal, this program runs based off (pseudo-)directories and commands that the user inputs. When the program starts you will be in the Root directory, shown as just ">". From here you can enter any command that works in the Root directory or any directory. A full list of commands, their arguments, and their valid directories can be seen in the Wiki or by the `help -more` command.

See full documentation in the Wiki.

## Misc Info
Commands and arguments are case-insensitive, meaning `create`, `CREATE`, and `cReATe` will all do the same thing.
