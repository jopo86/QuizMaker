# QuizMaker
A C++ terminal-like program to create, take, & share quizzes.

## Installation
The app is simply a standalone, cross-platform executable.   
To install, simply download the latest release .zip file, extract it, and run QuizMaker.exe under the QuizMaker folder.  
[Releases](https://mega.nz/folder/Xlxk0JhR#GEoC0FFyyR9OX82k4XjYNg)

Windows may stop the program from running, if this happens click 'More Info' and then 'Run anway'.

## How To Use
Like the terminal, this program runs based off (pseudo-)directories and commands that the user inputs. When the program starts you will be in the Root directory, shown as just ">". From here you can enter any command that works in the Root directory or any directory. A full list of commands, their arguments, and their valid directories can be seen in the [Wiki](https://github.com/jopo86/QuizMaker/wiki) or by the `help -more` command.

See full documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/jopo86/QuizMaker/wiki).

## Misc Info
Commands and arguments are case-insensitive, meaning `create`, `CREATE`, and `cReATe` will all do the same thing.
